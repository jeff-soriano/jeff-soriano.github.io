        I was born in Cali, but Reno NV is my hometown. I went to school there
        at the University of Nevada, Reno to obtain my degree in Computer
        Science & Engineering. Shortly afterward I worked in the gaming industry
        for a few years. Then I moved to Las Vegas, which is where I live now.

        I decided I wanted to work on web-based products and for companies that
        had a mission that reached beyond profits. In a few short months I
        taught myself React and NodeJS, which helped me land a job at Boundless
        Immigration. There, my skills grew to include Ruby on Rails.

        I'm looking forward to learning more things. I'm a fullstack developer
        with a slight preference towards the frontend. Right now I'm teaching
        myself the NextJS framework!
