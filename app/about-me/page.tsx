          I was born in Cali, but Reno NV is my hometown. I went to school there
          at the University of Nevada, Reno to obtain my{' '}
          <strong>degree in Computer Science & Engineering</strong>. Shortly
          afterward I worked in the gaming industry for a few years. Then I
          moved to Las Vegas, which is where I live now.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          I decided I wanted to work on web-based products and for companies
          that had a mission that reached beyond profits. In a few short months
          I taught myself <strong>React and NodeJS</strong>, which helped me
          land a job at Boundless Immigration. There, my skills grew to include{' '}
          <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm looking forward to learning more things. I'm a fullstack developer
          with a slight preference towards the frontend. Right now I'm teaching
          myself the <strong>NextJS</strong> framework, which is what this site
          was built in!

          Things I <strong>love</strong>: video games, barbecue, hangin' with my
          friends and family
        </p>
        <p>
          Things I <strong>hate</strong>: styrofoam, losing the Amazon Firestick
          remote
